compute NBO 
→ extract node/edge features 
→ align to a consistent atom index 
→ build graphs 
→ feed a GNN


3. all the feature results after nbo and multiwfn caculate are type of text, is there any method to catch the results to catch up these results without copy and paste? I just want to discuss with you first, please donot show me long code, we just discuss and let me learn how to do,then when we make a deal, we can start the code building
4.because the 20 molecules have different mol and atom index number, so
